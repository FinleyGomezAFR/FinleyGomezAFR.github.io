                                <p>Our dispute resolution team has consistently been recognised as one of the foremost litigation/dispute resolution teams in the island, focusing on a full range of services.  Our lawyers are able to meet the demanding and changing landscape of civil disputes. AFR’s dispute resolution team is led by partners Mark Ferbrache and Paul Richardson both of whom have considerable experience in litigation and receive high praise in the various legal directories.  The partners are supported by an experienced team of lawyers including advocates and senior associates and a support team of legal assistants. AFR is regularly instructed in the most high profile and complex disputes before the Guernsey courts.</p>
                                
                                 <h2>Services We Offer</h2>
                                 <h3>Alternative Dispute Resolution</h3>
                                 <p>Our litigation lawyers are experienced in all forms of alternative dispute resolution including arbitration, mediation, judicial determination, neutral evaluation and settlement meetings.</p>
                                 <h3>Arbitration</h3>
                                 <p>The team at AFR has an excellent record of securing the best possible results for its clients, developed over many years’ experience of successfully negotiating satisfactory outcomes. It frequently advises clients with regard to the arbitration process.  Our lawyers regularly appear before such tribunals, most particularly in relation to property and building disputes.</p>
                                 <h3>Asset Tracing</h3>
                                 <p>AFR has extensive experience of handling complex, multi-jurisdictional, high-value fraud and asset tracing claims for clients.  Aside from our offshore experience, we have a strong international workload and regularly act in relation to matters involving overseas jurisdictions. Many of the clients whom we advise are both on island and international financial institutions and service providers.  The London firms regularly instruct AFR, recognising the need to engage “hands on” lawyers with practical experience.</p>
                                 <h3>Banking Litigation</h3>
                                 <p>AFR has a first-class reputation for advising both on island and international banks and financial service providers on all types of domestic and international banking litigation.  AFR represents a number of major international banks. Our banking litigation experience includes: General debt recovery, Letter of credit disputes, Derivatives and financial instrument disputes, Fraud, Investigations and inquiries, Disputes arising from the banker-customer relationship including product mis-selling & Proceeds of crime matters.</p>
                                 <h3>Civil Litigation</h3>
                                 <p>AFR has an extremely varied litigation practice, acting for both claimants and defendants in personal injury, medical negligence, trust litigation, and all manner of commercial disputes.</p>
                                 <h3>Clinical Negligence</h3>
                                 <p>AFR is extremely experienced in representing all medical professionals in clinical negligence disputes. AFR acts in: Claims of medical and dental practice negligence, Representation and legal support at General Medical Council (GMC)/General Dental Council (GDC) proceedings, Advising and assisting in dealing with complaints and disciplinary matters & Providing legal representation and support at fatal accident inquiries and coroner's inquests.</p>
                                 <h3>Commercial Litigation</h3>
                                 <p>In respect of commercial and contractual disputes, AFR has extensive experience of acting for claimants and defendants at all levels.  Our work in this area is wide-ranging, and extends from simple contractual matters arising in Guernsey to large-scale international cases of considerable complexity.</p>
                                 <h3>Construction Disputes</h3>
                                 <p>AFR advises on all contentious and non-contentious issues affecting the building construction and land planning sectors, acting for a wide cross-section of the construction and engineering businesses in both the private and public sectors.  This gives AFR the expertise to resolve disputes in a straightforward and commercial manner. AFR is particularly strong in arbitration involving leasehold disputes.</p>
                                 <h3>Contentious Estates</h3>
                                 <p>Our contentious Trusts and Estates team has a wealth of experience on all aspects of trust and estate disputes, onshore and offshore.  AFR regularly advises on the resolution of disputes with a view to avoiding litigation where possible, on the formation of secure trust structures, and provides on-going advice on administrative risk regulation.   When litigation is unavoidable we act on cross-jurisdictional court actions and the negotiation of outcomes where differing laws conflict. AFR can advise on: Co-ordinating and managing complex trust and estate disputes, International and cross-jurisdictional trust and succession issues, Claims by and against trustees and personal representatives, including applications for Court guidance, Disputes between beneficiaries, Removal and appointment of trustees and personal representatives, International asset tracing and recovery & Accessory liability issues for the trustee. AFR has an extensive knowledge of the trust laws of a number of offshore jurisdictions and strong connections with local service providers.</p>
                                 <h3>Employment</h3>
                                 <p>AFR has one of the strongest employment teams on the island, regularly preparing cases for the Employment Tribunal and the Guernsey Royal Court.

                                 <h3>Mediation</h3>
                                 <p>How a dispute is resolved is key to securing the right outcome.  Mediation is an increasingly common way of resolving disputes and often results in creative solutions which are not otherwise possible by litigation alone. AFR has substantial experience both acting as mediators in disputes, and also representing clients at mediations.  We have acted for a full range of clients from individuals to large international companies.</p>
                                 <h3>Personal Injury</h3>

Our experienced personal injury lawyers will assess your case and advise you on claiming compensation including interim as well as final awards.</p>
                                 <h3>Professional Negligence & Indemnity</h3>
                                 <p>Professional negligence is a specialist area of law and can be highly technical.  If a professional practitioner has failed you in providing an appropriate service, you may have a claim against that professional for the loss (financial or otherwise) that you have suffered as a consequence of the inadequate service provided. Professional negligence is a specialist topic and not an area of general practice for many legal practitioners.  This has the effect of reducing the number of advocates who are sufficiently aware of the issues involved to enable them to undertake professional negligence work effectively. AFR understands the range of circumstances in which professional negligence claims can arise.  We have that expertise which is reflected in the increasing number of professional negligence cases on which we are instructed and the success we achieve in those cases. Professional negligence is an area which can involve claims against: The legal profession, Accountants, Surveyors, Architects, IT professionals, Financial advisers & Other such professional advisors. AFR has the necessary levels of experience, expertise and resources to provide advice, assistance and representation to clients who believe that they have a claim against a professional.</p>
                                 <h3>Trust Disputes / Litigation</h3>
                                 <p>AFR has extensive experience of advising and acting in complex, often multi-jurisdictional, trust disputes.  Although most disputes will involve private trusts, we have been appointed to act on behalf of clients dealing with disputes involving commercial trusts established for investment. Whether they concern claims by beneficiaries to obtain disclosure of trust documents, to secure the replacement of trustees or to obtain compensation from the trustees for breach of trust or advising trustees in relation to defending claims from beneficiaries, AFR has the experience necessary to ensure claims are approached in the best way from the outset to achieve our clients' aims. Contentious probate work, in particular, can be very stressful for clients who may be struggling to deal with bereavement issues at the same time as making decisions on legal issues.  We understand those concerns and always aim to give the clearest advice possible and to consider whether our clients can settle without the need for litigation.
